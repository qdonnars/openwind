"""Marine forecast types and adapter Protocol.

Direction conventions (mixed by physical phenomenon — mirrors meteorological and
oceanographic standards, do not normalise):

- Wind direction (``WindPoint.direction_deg``): "from" — meteo standard (TWD).
  0° = wind blowing from the north.
- Wave direction (``SeaPoint.wave_direction_deg``): "from" — same as wind.
- Ocean current direction (``SeaPoint.current_direction_to_deg``): "to" —
  oceanographic / nautical standard. 0° = current setting toward the north.

Any code comparing wind vs current bearings (e.g. wind-against-current scoring)
must explicitly normalise via ``(wind_from + 180) % 360`` to compare like with
like. Mixing them silently is a bug.

Speeds are in knots throughout the domain. Adapters convert at ingestion.

Relevance thresholds (``CURRENT_*``, ``TIDE_*``) match the user-visible filter:
currents and tide range only surface in the UI / MCP output when they exceed
these values per leg. Tuned for the French coast (Med < threshold typically;
Atlantic above on most legs).
