"""Per-point confidence labelling for current values.

The qualitative tag (``"high"`` / ``"medium"`` / ``"low"`` / ``None``) sits
beside ``current_source`` on each ``SegmentReport`` so the LLM and UI can
qualify a current value without re-deriving the rules.

The labelling is **source-based for now**. We previously shipped a
hand-drawn list of named narrow-pass bboxes (Goulet de Brest, Raz de Sein,
Goulet du Morbihan, etc.) to downgrade confidence inside known choke
points. That approach was unprincipled — bboxes drawn by intuition rather
than by physics — and has been removed. The data-driven replacement will
land with the SHOM Atlas C2D ingestion: zones where C2D peak speeds
exceed a threshold (e.g. ≥ 3 kt at vives-eaux) are exactly the zones
where every freely-available product under-resolves the choke, so the
confidence downgrade can be derived from the data instead of hand-drawn.

Until that adapter is wired, ``confidence_for_point`` reflects only the
source product's intrinsic resolution.
