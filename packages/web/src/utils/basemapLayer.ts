/**
 * The basemap, i.e. the coastline both maps are drawn on.
 *
 * Served by OpenFreeMap: vector tiles of the OpenStreetMap planet, no API
 * key, no account, no quota. We came here from CARTO, which used to serve
 * the same Positron look as plain raster and then started stamping
 * "API KEY REQUIRED" across every tile. Trading one keyless third party for
 * another would only reschedule that outage, so the criterion for the
 * replacement was that nothing about it can be revoked: OpenFreeMap's tiles
 * are public, its styles are open, and the whole stack is self-hostable the
 * day we need it to be.
 *
 * Vector rather than raster is the cost of that move. It buys crisp labels
 * at any pixel ratio and a real dark style, and it charges MapLibre GL in
 * the bundle plus a WebGL2 context per map. MapLibre renders inside Leaflet
 * through ``maplibre-gl-leaflet`` rather than replacing it: the layer lands
 * in ``tilePane`` (z-index 200), so the seamark overlay, the route and every
 * marker keep their panes and their code untouched.
