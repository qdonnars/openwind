/**
 * The state machine behind `/plan`.
 *
 * `PlanPage` used to hold twenty `useState` and drive them from a dozen
 * handlers and four effects. Three consequences, all of them user-visible:
 *
 * - **A race.** `doFetch` had no cancellation and no request id. Dragging a
 *   waypoint while a computation was in flight set `isStale`, then the reply
 *   landed, cleared it, and the old passage was displayed as fresh *and*
 *   persisted next to the new waypoints (annexe B, C1).
 * - **A shared spinner.** One `isLoading` for both the single computation and
 *   the sweep, so either one blanked the whole panel.
 * - **Scattered persistence.** URL rewrites, cache writes and draft writes
 *   happened from five different call sites, each with its own idea of when.
 *
 * Everything below is pure and tested without a DOM. The impure half (fetches,
 * abort controllers, localStorage, the address bar) lives in
 * `usePlanSession.ts` and only ever talks to this module through actions and
 * through the `persist` command the reducer emits.
 *
 * ## Ignoring a result that no longer applies
 *
 * Two independent guards, both needed:
 *
 * - `pending.id` vs the action's `requestId` drops the reply of a computation
 *   that a newer one has already replaced.
 * - `pending.editSeq` vs `editSeq` drops the reply of a computation whose
 *   inputs the user has edited since. `editSeq` is bumped by exactly the
 *   actions that mark the plan stale, so a change that does not invalidate a
 *   result (picking a mode, moving the sweep range) does not throw it away.
 *
 * A dropped reply clears the spinner and changes nothing else: `isStale` is
 * already true, so the panel is already offering « Recalculer ».
